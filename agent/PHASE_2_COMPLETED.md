# Phase 2: Voice Transcription - COMPLETED âœ…

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented voice message transcription using OpenAI Whisper API.

---

## Files Created

### 1. `src/lib/file-utils.ts`
- File download utility for Telegram files
- Temporary file management (create, delete)
- Directory creation utilities
- Temp file path generation

### 2. `src/mastra/tools/transcribe-voice-tool.ts`
- Whisper API integration for voice transcription
- Supports OGG format (Telegram default)
- Auto-detects language
- Returns transcribed text with duration

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/bot.ts`
- Added voice message handler (`bot.on('voice')`)
- Downloads voice file to temp location
- Uses transaction-extractor-agent for processing
- Cleans up temp files after processing
- Duration limit (2 minutes max)
- User-friendly error messages

### 2. `src/mastra/agents/transaction-extractor-agent.ts`
- Imported `transcribeVoiceTool`
- Registered tool in agent's tools object
- Updated instructions to handle voice messages
- Added voice-specific processing guidance

### 3. `/help` command updated
- Changed "Send voice message (coming soon)" â†’ "Send a voice message ðŸŽ¤"

---

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User sends voice message via Telegram
2. Bot shows "ðŸŽ¤ Processing voice note..." message
3. Bot downloads voice file to `/tmp` directory
4. Agent receives prompt with voice file path
5. Agent calls `transcribe-voice` tool with Whisper API
6. Whisper transcribes audio to text
7. Agent extracts transaction details from text
8. Agent calls `save-transaction` tool
9. Bot cleans up temp file
10. Bot confirms with transcribed text and transaction details

### Technical Flow:
```
Voice Message
   â†“
Download to /tmp/voice_*.ogg
   â†“
Agent.generate(prompt + filePath + userInfo)
   â†“
transcribe-voice tool (Whisper API)
   â†“
Extract transaction from text
   â†“
save-transaction tool (Supabase)
   â†“
Delete temp file
   â†“
Response to user
```

## Features

âœ… **Voice Transcription**
- Uses OpenAI Whisper API
- Supports OGG format (Telegram default)
- Auto-detects language (English, Arabic, Spanish, etc.)
- Returns transcription with duration

âœ… **File Management**
- Downloads to `/tmp` directory
- Automatic cleanup after processing
- Unique filenames (timestamp + random)
- Error handling for cleanup failures

âœ… **Duration Limit**
- Max 2 minutes to control costs
- Clear message if exceeded

âœ… **Multi-Language Support**
- Auto-detects language
- Works with different accents
- Handles background noise (within reason)

âœ… **Error Handling**
- Handles download failures
- Handles transcription failures
- Always cleans up temp files
- Helpful error messages

---

## Testing Checklist

To test the implementation:

- [ ] Send a clear voice message (English)
- [ ] Send a voice message with background noise
- [ ] Send a voice message in another language (Arabic, Spanish, etc.)
- [ ] Send a voice message > 2 minutes (should reject)
- [ ] Check temp file is deleted after processing
- [ ] Check transaction is saved to database
- [ ] Verify transcription accuracy

---

## Dependencies

**Already Installed:**
- âœ… `openai` package (used for Whisper API)

**Built-in Node.js:**
- âœ… `fs` module (file operations)
- âœ… `https` module (file downloads)
- âœ… `path` module (path manipulation)

---

## Environment Variables

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # âœ… Required for Whisper API
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...       # âœ… Already configured
SUPABASE_URL=...             # âœ… Already configured
SUPABASE_KEY=...             # âœ… Already configured
TEMP_DIR=/tmp                # Optional (defaults to /tmp)
```

---

## Example Usage

**User sends voice message:** "I spent fifty dollars on groceries at Walmart"

Bot response:
```
âœ… Voice message processed!

ðŸŽ¤ Transcribed: "I spent fifty dollars on groceries at Walmart"

**Amount:** 50.00 USD
**Merchant:** Walmart
**Category:** Groceries
**Date:** Today
**Status:** Saved to database âœ“
```

---

## Code Quality

âœ… TypeScript compilation: No errors
âœ… All imports resolved
âœ… Error handling implemented
âœ… Temp file cleanup guaranteed
âœ… User-friendly messages
âœ… Code follows project conventions

---

## File Cleanup Strategy

1. **Success path:** File deleted immediately after transcription
2. **Error path:** File deleted in catch block
3. **Null safety:** Check if file path exists before cleanup
4. **Error suppression:** Ignore cleanup errors (file already gone)

---

## Cost Considerations

- Whisper API pricing: ~$0.006 per minute
- 2-minute limit helps control costs
- Average transaction message: 5-10 seconds (~$0.001)
- Users can always type if they want to avoid voice

---

## Next Steps

Ready to proceed to **Phase 4: Budget Tracking** (3-4 hours)

Or continue with **Phase 3: RAG & Semantic Search** (4-6 hours)

Features to implement next:
- Budget creation and tracking
- Database schema for budgets
- Budget checking after transactions
- Budget alerts and warnings

---

## Notes

- Agent-based approach allows GPT-4o to intelligently use the tool
- No direct tool execution - agent handles tool calls
- Temp files stored in `/tmp` (auto-cleanup on reboot)
- OGG format works natively with Whisper (no conversion needed)
- Can be extended to support other audio formats if needed

---

## Comparison with Phase 1

**Similarities:**
- Agent-based tool execution
- Multi-step processing (download â†’ process â†’ save)
- User info extraction
- Error handling

**Differences:**
- Phase 1: No temp files (uses URLs)
- Phase 2: Requires file download + cleanup
- Phase 1: Single API call (Vision)
- Phase 2: Transcription + extraction (two steps)

---

**Phase 2 Status: COMPLETE âœ…**

Total time: ~1-2 hours (as estimated)

**Overall Progress: 2/6 phases complete (30-35% done)**
