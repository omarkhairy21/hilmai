# Reddit r/SaaS Post

**Title:** Show HN: Hilm – AI that logs spending, tracks patterns, and gives personalized money advice

Hey r/SaaS,

Built **Hilm** ([hilm.ai](https://hilm.ai)) because I couldn't answer: *"How much did I spend on groceries last month?"*

**The problem:** Traditional expense tracking apps require manual categorization and complex setup. Most people give up after a few weeks.

**The solution:** AI assistant via Telegram. Log expenses by text/voice/photo, ask questions naturally, get instant insights.

**Use cases:**
- Grad student with $15k debt: "If I pay $500/month, when am I debt-free?"
- Freelancer with variable income: "How much can I safely spend this month?"
- Anyone building savings: "Where is my money actually going?"

**Why it works:**
- Frictionless logging (5 seconds, anywhere)
- Conversational interface (no forms or menus)
- Automatic categorization
- Real-time financial insights

**Tech:** GPT-4o + Supabase pgvector + Mastra. Replaced Pinecone with pgvector (saved $70/month).

**Pricing:** Free tier + $16/month unlimited. 7-day free trial.

**Try it:** [hilm.ai/app](https://hilm.ai/app)
