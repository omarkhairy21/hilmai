#### Template 1: For Posts About Discovering Hidden Spending

That's such a common realization! Those small daily expenses really add up fast. I had a similar moment with takeout - didn't think $12-15 here and there was much until I saw it totaled $300+ in a month.

The key is catching those expenses as they happen, not trying to remember them later. I built an AI-powered assistant called hilm.ai that lets me just message expenses as I spend (like "coffee $4" or "lunch $12") and it automatically categorizes and tracks everything. But the cool part is you can actually chat with it - ask "how much did I spend on coffee this month?" and it gives you instant insights. It's been a game-changer for catching those small purchases before they become big problems.

Happy to share the link if you want to try it - it's free and takes like 30 seconds to set up. Either way, great job on tracking and making that change!

#### Template 2: For Posts Asking for Tracking Solutions

I totally get the struggle with manual tracking - spreadsheets are tedious and easy to forget about.

I actually built an AI-powered assistant called hilm.ai for this exact problem. You just message it your expenses as they happen (voice or text), and it automatically categorizes and tracks everything. But what makes it special is you can actually have conversations with it - ask questions like "where is my money going?" or "am I spending too much on X?" and it gives you instant answers based on your actual spending. No app to download, no complex setup. Just natural conversation.

It's free to use and might be worth checking out if you want something simpler than spreadsheets. Let me know if you want the link!

#### Template 3: For Posts About Mint/YNAB Alternatives

Sorry to hear about [Mint shutting down/struggling with YNAB]. Finding the right tool is frustrating.

I actually built an AI-powered expense tracker called hilm.ai that's super simple - no complex setup, just chat with it naturally. You message expenses as you spend, but you can also ask it questions about your spending and get instant insights. It's like having a conversation with your finances instead of digging through menus.

It's free and might be worth checking out if you want something lightweight and conversational. Happy to share more details if you're interested. Either way, hope you find something that works for you!

Love that you're being proactive about [debt payoff/saving goal]! Tracking is definitely the foundation.

I built an AI-powered assistant called hilm.ai that makes expense tracking super quick - just message expenses as they happen and it automatically categorizes everything. But the real value is you can actually talk to it - ask "how am I doing on my goal?" or "what should I cut back on?" and it gives you personalized advice based on your spending patterns. It's helped me stay consistent because I can log things immediately AND get insights on demand.

Free to use if you want to check it out. Good luck hitting that goal!
