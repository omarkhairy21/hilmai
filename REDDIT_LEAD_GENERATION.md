  - Building simple payoff plans ("If you pay $X/month you'll be debt-free by Y")
  - Suggesting realistic monthly targets based on income, rent, and essentials
  - Tracking progress toward specific goals (e.g., paying off a $15k card)

### Example DM: Grad Student with Credit Card Debt

**Scenario:** Grad student with $15k credit card debt, $2k-$2.8k/month variable income, $1200/month fixed expenses, paying $500/month toward debt, asking for advice on managing finances daily and paying off debt effectively.

**DM:**

Hey [username],

Saw your post about tackling $15k in credit card debt as a grad student. That's really tough, especially with variable income from TA duties - I know how stressful that uncertainty can be.

I built hilm.ai to help with exactly this situation. It's an AI assistant that helps you plan month-by-month while still covering your essentials. You can ask things like "if I keep paying $500/month, when will I be debt-free?" or "how much can I safely spend on groceries this month given my income?" It shows you how different payment amounts change your payoff timeline, and helps you see if you can squeeze out a bit more when your income is higher.

The best part is it tracks everything automatically - just message expenses as you spend (text, voice, or receipt photo) and it categorizes everything. No spreadsheets, no complex apps. It's designed for tight budgets and irregular income, so it understands that some months you have more flexibility than others.

It's free to use and might help you get a clearer picture of your path forward: https://hilm.ai/app

Hope this helps. Let me know if you have questions!
