# Why I Built hilm.ai

Hi, I'm the founder of hilm.ai. I wanted to share the personal story behind why I built this product—because it started with a problem I couldn't solve.

## The Inspiration

I was inspired by Morgan Housel's book **"The Art of Spending Money"**, where he talks about owning your future through saving while preventing saving addiction or overspending. Finding the right balance requires data about your spending and insights—but I realized I had neither.

## The Questions I Couldn't Answer

As I tried to apply these principles to my own life, I found myself asking questions I simply couldn't answer:

- **Spending Patterns:** How much did I spend last 3 months on shopping, dining, or groceries? I had no clue.
- **Balance Check:** Am I overspending or over-saving? Am I truly owning my future?
- **Margin of Safety:** If I get laid off, do I have 6 months of expenses covered? What's my short-term safety net?
- **Investment Readiness:** How about investing? Do I have the right foundation to start?

Traditional expense tracking apps felt like work. They required manual entry, complex categorization, and time I didn't have. I needed something that fit into my life naturally—like sending a message to a friend.

## The Solution

So I built hilm.ai as an AI agent for myself first—to get answers at any moment. To understand my spending patterns, track my progress toward financial goals, and make informed decisions about saving, spending, and investing.

The idea was simple: what if tracking expenses was as easy as sending a text message, voice note, or photo of a receipt? What if I could ask questions about my spending in natural language and get instant insights?

Now it's available for anyone who wants to own their financial future with data-driven insights.
