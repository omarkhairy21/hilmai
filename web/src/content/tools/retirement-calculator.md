- **40**: 3x annual salary saved
- **50**: 6x annual salary saved
- **60**: 8x annual salary saved
- **67**: 10x annual salary saved

### The 4% Rule

## Tips for Retirement Savings

## Common Retirement Accounts
- **401(k)**: Employer-sponsored, often with matching

## Common Questions

**How much do I need to retire?**
A common rule is 25x your annual expenses, or enough to withdraw 4% annually. For $50,000/year expenses, aim for $1.25M.

**When should I start saving?**
As early as possible! Even small amounts compound significantly over time.

**What return rate should I use?**
For long-term stock market investments, 6-8% is reasonable. Be conservative (6%) for planning purposes.

**Should I pay off debt or save for retirement?**
Do both! Contribute enough to get employer match, pay off high-interest debt, then increase retirement savings.

**What if I'm behind on retirement savings?**
Increase contributions, work longer, reduce expenses, or consider catch-up contributions if over 50.
