## Common Questions

**Should I have multiple savings goals?**
Yes, but prioritize. Focus on emergency fund first, then other goals. You can save for multiple goals simultaneously by allocating percentages of your savings.

**Where should I keep my savings?**
For short-term goals (under 2 years), use a high-yield savings account. For longer-term goals, consider CDs or investment accounts.

**What if I can't meet my monthly goal?**
Adjust your timeline or goal amount. It's better to save consistently at a lower amount than to give up entirely.

**Should I save or pay off debt first?**
Build a small emergency fund ($1,000), then focus on high-interest debt. After that, build your full emergency fund, then other savings goals.

**Can I use this for retirement savings?**
This calculator works for any savings goal, but retirement planning typically requires more complex calculations considering investment returns and inflation.
