# Debt-to-Income Ratio Calculator

## Overview
Your Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio is a key financial metric that lenders use to assess your ability to manage monthly payments and repay debts. It compares your monthly debt payments to your monthly gross income.

## Why DTI Matters
- **Loan approval**: Lenders use DTI to determine loan eligibility
- **Interest rates**: Lower DTI often means better interest rates
- **Financial health**: Indicates how much of your income goes to debt
- **Budget planning**: Helps identify if you're overextended

## How to Calculate DTI
DTI = (Total Monthly Debt Payments / Monthly Gross Income) × 100

**Monthly Debt Payments Include:**
- Mortgage or rent
- Auto loans
- Student loans
- Credit card minimum payments
- Personal loans
- Other recurring debt payments

**Do NOT Include:**
- Utilities
- Insurance premiums
- Groceries
- Entertainment
- Savings contributions

## DTI Ranges

### Excellent (0-20%)
- Very manageable debt load
- Strong financial position
- Best loan terms available

### Good (21-35%)
- Healthy debt level
- Most lenders consider this acceptable
- Room for additional debt if needed

### Fair (36-43%)
- Approaching the limit
- May have difficulty getting new loans
- Consider reducing debt

### Poor (44-50%)
- High debt burden
- Difficult to get approved for loans
- Focus on debt reduction

### Very Poor (50%+)
- Critical debt level
- Likely struggling to make payments
- Urgent need to reduce debt

## How to Improve Your DTI
1. **Increase income**: Ask for a raise, get a side job, or freelance
2. **Reduce debt**: Pay off debts faster, especially high-interest ones
3. **Avoid new debt**: Don't take on additional loans or credit cards
4. **Refinance**: Lower interest rates can reduce monthly payments
5. **Consolidate**: Combine multiple debts into one lower payment

## Common Questions

**What's a good DTI ratio?**
For most lenders, 36% or below is ideal. For mortgage approval, many lenders prefer 28% or less for housing costs alone.

**Should I include rent in DTI?**
Yes, rent counts as a monthly debt payment for DTI calculation purposes.

**Does DTI affect my credit score?**
DTI doesn't directly affect credit scores, but high DTI can make it harder to get approved for new credit, which can impact your credit utilization.

**Can I have a high DTI and good credit?**
Yes, but lenders may still be cautious. They want to see that you can handle new debt payments.

**How often should I check my DTI?**
Review it quarterly or whenever your income or debt changes significantly.
