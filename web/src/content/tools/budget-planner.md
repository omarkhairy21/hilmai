# Monthly Budget Planner

## Overview
A monthly budget planner helps you allocate your income across different expense categories before the month begins. This proactive approach prevents overspending and ensures you're prioritizing your financial goals.

## Why Plan Your Budget
- **Control spending**: Decide where money goes before you spend it
- **Achieve goals**: Allocate money toward savings and debt payoff
- **Reduce stress**: Knowing you have a plan reduces financial anxiety
- **Track progress**: Compare planned vs actual spending

## How to Use the Planner
1. **List your income**: Enter all sources of monthly income
2. **List fixed expenses**: Rent, utilities, insurance, subscriptions
3. **Estimate variable expenses**: Food, transportation, entertainment
4. **Allocate savings**: Emergency fund, retirement, goals
5. **Balance**: Ensure income equals expenses + savings
6. **Track actual**: Use hilm.ai to compare planned vs actual spending

## Tips for Success
- **Be realistic**: Base estimates on past spending, not ideals
- **Review monthly**: Adjust based on actual spending patterns
- **Include savings**: Treat savings as a non-negotiable expense
- **Plan for irregular expenses**: Annual fees, car maintenance, etc.
- **Use tools**: Track actual spending with hilm.ai for accuracy

## Common Budgeting Mistakes
- **Too restrictive**: Unrealistic budgets lead to failure
- **Forgetting irregular expenses**: Annual costs need monthly allocation
- **Not tracking actual spending**: Plan means nothing without tracking
- **Ignoring small expenses**: They add up quickly
- **No emergency category**: Unexpected expenses derail budgets

## Common Questions

**How do I handle irregular income?**
Use your lowest expected monthly income for budgeting. Save excess in high months to cover low months.

**What if my expenses exceed income?**
Cut expenses, increase income, or both. Start with wants (entertainment, dining out) before needs.

**Should I budget for every category?**
Yes, but you can group similar categories. The key is accounting for all spending.

**How often should I review my budget?**
Monthly reviews are ideal. Compare planned vs actual and adjust for the next month.

**Can I use this with the 50/30/20 rule?**
Yes! The 50/30/20 rule is a framework. Use this planner to allocate within those percentages.
