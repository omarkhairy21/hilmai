# 50/30/20 Budget Calculator

## Overview
The 50/30/20 budget rule is a simple and effective method for managing your finances. It divides your after-tax income into three categories:
- **50% for Needs**: Essential expenses like housing, utilities, groceries, transportation, insurance
- **30% for Wants**: Non-essential expenses like dining out, entertainment, hobbies, subscriptions
- **20% for Savings**: Emergency fund, retirement, investments, debt payments beyond minimums

## How It Works
This budgeting method was popularized by Senator Elizabeth Warren in her book "All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan." It provides a balanced approach to managing money without requiring detailed tracking of every expense category.

## Benefits
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and implement
- **Balanced**: Ensures you cover essentials while still enjoying life
- **Flexible**: Adapts to different income levels
- **Future-focused**: Prioritizes savings and financial security

## How to Use the Calculator
1. Enter your monthly after-tax income (take-home pay)
2. The calculator automatically breaks down your budget into the three categories
3. Review the amounts and adjust your spending accordingly
4. Track your actual spending with hilm.ai to see how it compares

## Tips for Success
- **Be honest about needs vs wants**: Housing is a need, but a luxury apartment might be a want
- **Include all income**: Use your total take-home pay, including side income
- **Review monthly**: Your income and expenses may change, so recalculate regularly
- **Track actual spending**: Use hilm.ai to see where your money really goes

## Common Questions

**What counts as "needs"?**
Needs are expenses you cannot avoid: housing, utilities, groceries, transportation to work, insurance, minimum debt payments, and basic healthcare.

**What counts as "wants"?**
Wants are expenses that improve your quality of life but aren't essential: dining out, entertainment, hobbies, gym memberships, streaming services, and non-essential shopping.

**What if my needs exceed 50%?**
If you live in a high-cost area, your needs might exceed 50%. Try to reduce wants to compensate, or focus on increasing your income. The goal is to get as close to the ratio as possible.

**Can I adjust the percentages?**
Yes! The 50/30/20 rule is a guideline. If you're aggressively paying off debt, you might do 50/20/30 (needs/wants/savings). The key is having a plan.
