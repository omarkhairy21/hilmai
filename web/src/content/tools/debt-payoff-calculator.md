# Debt Payoff Calculator

## Overview
The Debt Payoff Calculator helps you create a strategic plan to eliminate debt faster and save money on interest. It compares two popular methods: the debt snowball and debt avalanche approaches.

## Debt Payoff Methods

### Debt Snowball Method
- Pay off smallest debts first
- Provides quick wins and motivation
- Psychological benefits from seeing debts disappear
- May pay more interest overall

### Debt Avalanche Method
- Pay off highest interest rate debts first
- Saves the most money on interest
- Mathematically optimal approach
- May take longer to see first debt eliminated

## How to Use the Calculator
1. Enter each debt: balance, interest rate, and minimum payment
2. Enter your total monthly debt payment budget
3. Choose your payoff method (snowball or avalanche)
4. View your payoff timeline and total interest paid
5. Track your progress with hilm.ai

## Tips for Faster Debt Payoff
- **Increase payments**: Even $50-100 extra per month makes a big difference
- **Stop using credit**: Don't add new debt while paying off old debt
- **Consider balance transfers**: Move high-interest debt to lower-rate cards (if you qualify)
- **Negotiate rates**: Call creditors to request lower interest rates
- **Use windfalls**: Apply tax refunds, bonuses, or gifts to debt

## Common Questions

**Which method is better?**
The avalanche method saves more money, but the snowball method provides better motivation. Choose based on what keeps you committed.

**Should I pay off debt or save?**
Start with a small emergency fund ($1,000), then focus on high-interest debt (over 7-8%). Low-interest debt can be paid off more slowly while you build savings.

**What if I can only make minimum payments?**
Focus on increasing your income or reducing expenses to free up more money for debt payments. Even small increases accelerate payoff.

**Should I consolidate my debt?**
Debt consolidation can help if you get a lower interest rate, but it doesn't reduce the total amount owed. Make sure the new rate is actually lower.

**What about student loans?**
Student loans often have lower interest rates. Consider paying minimums while building savings and investing, unless rates are high (over 6-7%).
