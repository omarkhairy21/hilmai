# Investment Return Calculator

## Overview
The Investment Return Calculator helps you project the future value of your investments based on initial investment, monthly contributions, expected return rate, and time period. It's useful for planning investments and understanding the power of compound growth.

## How Compound Interest Works
Compound interest means you earn returns on both your initial investment and previously earned returns. Over time, this creates exponential growth, making time your greatest asset in investing.

## How to Use the Calculator
1. Enter your initial investment amount
2. Enter your monthly contribution (if any)
3. Set your expected annual return rate
4. Enter the investment time period (years)
5. View your projected investment value and total returns

## Expected Return Rates
- **Savings Account**: 0.5-2% annually
- **Bonds**: 3-5% annually
- **Balanced Portfolio**: 6-8% annually
