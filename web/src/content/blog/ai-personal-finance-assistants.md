### 2. ChatGPT (OpenAI) - General-Purpose AI

**Best For**: General financial questions and education

ChatGPT is a powerful general-purpose AI that can answer financial questions and provide educational content about personal finance.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive knowledge base
- Explains complex financial concepts
- Free tier available
- Good for learning and research

**Limitations:**
- Cannot access your personal financial data
- No automatic transaction tracking
- Requires manual data entry for analysis
- Cannot process receipt photos or voice messages

**Pricing:** Free tier available, ChatGPT Plus: $20/month

ChatGPT is excellent for learning about personal finance concepts, but it cannot replace a dedicated expense tracking tool since it lacks access to your actual financial data.

### 3. Other AI Finance Tools

Several other AI-powered finance tools are emerging:
- **Copilot Money**: AI-powered budgeting with transaction categorization
- **YNAB**: Rule-based budgeting with AI insights
- **Mint**: Automated expense tracking with categorization

However, most traditional finance apps use AI as a supplementary feature rather than as the core interface, making them less conversational and more form-based.
